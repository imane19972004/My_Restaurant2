Feature: Restaurant TimeSlot Management
              As a restaurant manager
              I want to manage available time slots for orders
  So that I can control order capacity throughout the day

        Background:
            Given a restaurant "Le Bistrot" exists
              And the restaurant manager is logged in to "Le Bistrot"

        Scenario: Define available time slots with capacity
             When the restaurant manager creates a time slot from "12:00" to "12:30" with capacity 10
              And the restaurant manager creates a time slot from "12:30" to "13:00" with capacity 15
             Then the restaurant should have 2 time slots available
              And the time slot "12:00-12:30" should have capacity 10
              And the time slot "12:30-13:00" should have capacity 15

        Scenario: Block a time slot when capacity is full
            Given a time slot from "12:00" to "12:30" exists with capacity 3
             When the restaurant manager blocks the time slot "12:00-12:30" 3 times
             Then the time slot "12:00-12:30" should have capacity 0
              And the time slot "12:00-12:30" should not be available for booking

        Scenario: Unblock a previously blocked time slot
            Given a time slot from "12:00" to "12:30" exists with capacity 0
             When the restaurant manager unblocks the time slot "12:00-12:30"
             Then the time slot "12:00-12:30" should have capacity greater than 0
              And the time slot "12:00-12:30" should be available for booking

        Scenario: Prevent negative capacity
            Given a time slot from "12:00" to "12:30" exists with capacity 1
             When the restaurant manager blocks the time slot "12:00-12:30" 5 times
             Then the time slot "12:00-12:30" should have capacity 0
              And the system should not allow negative capacity

        Scenario: View all available time slots for a specific day
            Given a time slot from "11:30" to "12:00" exists with capacity 5
              And a time slot from "12:00" to "12:30" exists with capacity 0
              And a time slot from "12:30" to "13:00" exists with capacity 10
             When the restaurant manager requests all available time slots
             Then the restaurant manager should see 2 available time slots
              And the list should include "11:30-12:00"
              And the list should include "12:30-13:00"
              But the list should not include "12:00-12:30"

        Scenario: Update time slot capacity
            Given a time slot from "12:00" to "12:30" exists with capacity 10
             When the restaurant manager updates the time slot "12:00-12:30" capacity to 20
             Then the time slot "12:00-12:30" should have capacity 20

        Scenario: Restaurant with no time slots configured
            Given the restaurant has no time slots configured
             When the restaurant manager requests all available time slots
             Then the restaurant manager should see 0 available time slots
              And a warning message "No time slots configured" should be displayed
